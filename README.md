# classified.html

classified.html is a portable encryption solution with some unique features:
- Everything is contained into a single .html file, including the data â†’ easy to backup, move and share
- For all major platforms: This single file can be accessed both from the browser and terminal with NodeJS (this means that `classified.html` is a legit HTML and JavaScript file at the same time!)

Other features:
- Uses efficient and well tested cryptographic implementations through [Web Crpyto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
- No external dependencies, works fully offline
- 256-bit AES-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 password key derivation function offers protection against brute forcing the password
- Both PC and mobile browser support

To start using: choose a password, write text and click save. This saves the text and the website encrypted into a single file, which can be accessed offline.

To test this go to [online demo](https://classifiedhtml.com), download and open `classified.html` in browser or open with NodeJS by running `node classified.html`.

## Advanced use

Supported terminal commands can be found out by running `node classified.html --help`.

Note that these commands can be passed as commandline arguments (`node classified.html show row mysecret`), or after opening the file with `node classified.html` + `show row mysecret`.

# Security
TLDR: this is mainly a consept which might have security issues and/or corrupt the data, for critical data I'd recommend [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) for proper offline encryption
- If this consept is implemented properly, as far as I know the browser side should be quite secure if you assume that you dont have any malicious keylogging programs or browser extensions
- When opened in terminal side, the program attempts to clear all shown secrets after use, but this data might be accessible through some means on some platforms

If you have any concerns, comments or improvements to the security side, I'm eager to hear them, please for example create new Issue or PR

# Development

Please create issues/PRs if you have any bugs reports or improvements to the current state. New features might not be accepted as this consept currently aims to be as simple as possible.

`classified.html` is generated automatically by installing everything with `npm ci`and then running `npm run build` **inside** src/ directory.

Other commands inside src/ directory:  
`npm start`: execute in terminal with NodeJS  
`npm run lint`: forces styling  
`npm run precommit`: lint + build  
`npm run all`: lint + build + start  

For browser UI only changes, you can edit the `src/mockPage.html` directly, and open it on the browser to see the changes. Then when you are happy with the results you can use `npm run build` to get those changes included into `classified.html`, and test the changes with the full application.

# Key learnings

- Hard to make work on browser and Nodejs at same time, but possible:
    - built in base64 encode/decode on browsers and NodeJS did not seem to be compatible --> [base64-js](https://github.com/beatgammit/base64-js/blob/master/index.js) was included into source to make sure there are no compatibility issues with different platforms
    - Browser does not have a interface to return unmodified html source (`document.documentElement.innerHTML` does not work for example), which is required for saving --> as much as possible should be inside `<script>` tags, such as css 
- iPhone Safari does not open individual .html files :(
