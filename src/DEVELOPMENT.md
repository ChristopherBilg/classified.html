To make the development easier, modifications are not done directly from the single classified.html file.

# Generating new classified.html file

First install everything with `npm ci` and then running `npm run build` **inside** src/ directory.

The `classified.html` is then generated by running `npm run build`.

What it does, it reads `../LICENCE`, `base64-js.js`, `mockPage.html` files, and injects the contents to the `main.js`, and writes the result to `../classified.html` as spesified in the `build.js`.

# Developing classified.html

To modify the functionality, edit `main.js`.

To change the browser frontend html/css, edit `mockPage.html`. This file can be opened by itself.

These changes are added to classified.html by running `npm run build`

## npm commands

- `npm start`: starts the program in NodeJS, browser start is a manual process
- `npm run build`: generates new classified.html file to the root
- `npm run lint`: runs eslint, configured in `.eslintrc.json`
- `npm run precommit`: lints and builds, do this before each commit
- `npm run all`: lints, builds and runs the program in NodeJS

check `package.json` for more info.
